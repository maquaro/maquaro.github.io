  Considering linear dynamic panel data models with fixed effects, existing outlierâ€“robust estimators based on the median ratio of two consecutive pairs of first-differenced data are extended to higher-order differencing. The estimation procedure is thus based on many pairwise differences and their ratios and is designed to combine high precision and good robust properties. In particular, the proposed two-step GMM estimator based on the corresponding moment equations relies on an innovative weighting scheme reflecting both the variance and bias of those moment equations, where the bias is assumed to stem from data contamination. To estimate the bias, the influence function is derived and evaluated. The robust properties of the estimator are characterized both under contamination by independent additive outliers and the patches of additive outliers. The proposed estimator is additionally compared with existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

  This paper extends an existing outlier-robust estimator of linear dynamic panel data models with fixed effects, which is based on the median ratio of two consecutive pairs of first-order differenced data. To improve its precision and robustness properties, a general procedure based on higher-order pairwise differences and their ratios is designed. The asymptotic distribution of this class of estimators is derived. Further, the breakdown point properties are obtained under contamination by independent additive outliers and by the patches of additive outliers, and are used to select the pairwise differences that do not compromise the robustness properties of the procedure. The proposed estimator is additionally compared with existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

  The panel-data regression models are frequently applied to micro-level data, which often suffer from data contamination, erroneous observations, or unobserved heterogeneity. Despite the adverse effects of outliers on classical estimation methods, there are only a few robust estimation methods available for fixed-effects panel data. A new estimation approach based on two different data transformations is therefore proposed. Considering several robust estimation methods applied to the transformed data, the robust and asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, including their breakdown points and asymptotic distributions. The finite-sample performance of the existing and proposed methods is compared by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper considers the problem of identification, estimation and inference in the case of spatial panel data models with heterogeneous spatial lag coefficients, with and without (weakly) exogenous regressors, and subject to heteroskedastic errors. A quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimation procedure is developed and the conditions for identification of spatial coefficients are derived. Regularity conditions are established for the QML estimators of individual spatial coefficients, as well as their means (the mean group estimators), to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for Gaussian and non-Gaussian errors, and with spatial weight matrices of differing degrees of sparsity. The simulation results are in line with the paper's key theoretical findings even for panels with moderate time dimensions, irrespective of the number of cross section units. An empirical application to U.S. house price changes during the 1975-2014 period shows a significant degree of heterogeneity in spill-over effects over the 338 Metropolitan Statistical Areas considered.
