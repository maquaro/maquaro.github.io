  <p>Cross-regional mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transfer control and
  diffuse knowledge across space, which facilitates the integration of business
  systems. We analyse about 40,000 cross-regional acquisitions in Europe
  completed between 2003 and 2017 and distinguish innovative and non-innovative
  M&A. Both types of deals cluster into communities constituted by countries
  or groups of neighbouring countries. However, an increasing proportion of
  deals connect different communities, especially for innovative M&A. More
  populous and richer regions host more acquiring and target companies and thus
  broker communities. Research and development expenditure and skilled human
  capital are additional factors favouring brokerage of regions by attracting
  acquirers.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This paper considers the estimation and inference of spatial panel data
  models with heterogeneous spatial lag coefficients, with and without weakly
  exogenous regressors, and subject to heteroskedastic errors. A quasi maximum
  likelihood (QML) estimation procedure is developed and the conditions for
  identification of the spatial coefficients are derived. The QML estimators of
  individual spatial coefficients, as well as their mean group estimators, are
  shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Small‐sample properties of
  the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations and
  results are shown to be in line with the paper's key theoretical findings,
  even for panels with moderate time dimensions and irrespective of the number
  of cross‐section units. A detailed empirical application to US house price
  changes during the 1975–2014 period shows a significant degree of
  heterogeneity in spatiotemporal dynamics over the 338 Metropolitan
  Statistical Areas considered.</p>

**Robust estimation and moment selection in dynamic fixed-effects panel data models**<br/>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>Considering linear dynamic panel data models with fixed effects,
    existing outlier–robust estimators based on the median ratio of two
    consecutive pairs of first-differenced data are extended to higher-order
    differencing. The estimation procedure is thus based on many pairwise
    differences and their ratios and is designed to combine high precision and
    good robust properties. In particular, the proposed two-step GMM estimator
    based on the corresponding moment equations relies on an innovative
    weighting scheme reflecting both the variance and bias of those moment
    equations, where the bias is assumed to stem from data contamination. To
    estimate the bias, the influence function is derived and evaluated. The
    robust properties of the estimator are characterized both under
    contamination by independent additive outliers and the patches of additive
    outliers. The proposed estimator is additionally compared with existing
    methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This paper extends an existing outlier-robust estimator of linear dynamic
  panel data models with fixed effects, which is based on the median ratio of
  two consecutive pairs of first-order differenced data. To improve its
  precision and robustness properties, a general procedure based on
  higher-order pairwise differences and their ratios is designed. The
  asymptotic distribution of this class of estimators is derived. Further, the
  breakdown point properties are obtained under contamination by independent
  additive outliers and by the patches of additive outliers, and are used to
  select the pairwise differences that do not compromise the robustness
  properties of the procedure. The proposed estimator is additionally compared
  with existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

**One-step robust estimation of fixed-effects panel data models**<br/>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>The panel-data regression models are frequently applied to micro-level
  data, which often suffer from data contamination, erroneous observations, or
  unobserved heterogeneity. Despite the adverse effects of outliers on
  classical estimation methods, there are only a few robust estimation methods
  available for fixed-effects panel data. A new estimation approach based on
  two different data transformations is therefore proposed. Considering several
  robust estimation methods applied to the transformed data, the robust and
  asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, including their
  breakdown points and asymptotic distributions. The finite-sample performance
  of the existing and proposed methods is compared by means of Monte Carlo
  simulations.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) entail the substantial reallocation of
  economic activities. When they involve distant acquiring and target
  companies, they transfer control and diffuse knowledge across locations,
  which in turn facilitates the process of the integration of business systems.
  This study aims to understand how cross-regional European M&A facilitate the
  process of European integration. We applied social network analysis and
  regression techniques to a sample of cross-regional acquisitions between 2003
  and 2017. The data allow us to identify whether or not a target company had
  an active patent portfolio at the time of deal completion. Both types of
  deals are highly concentrated in economically more developed regions and
  cluster into communities constituted by countries or groups of neighbouring
  countries. However, a large and increasingly non-trivial proportion of deals
  connect different communities, and to a larger extent for innovative than for
  non-innovative M&A. More populous and richer regions host a disproportionally
  larger number of acquiring and target companies and thus connect fragmented
  communities. The intensity of R&D-related expenditures provides an additional
  factor favouring the connection of fragmented groups of regions by attracting
  technology-seeking acquirers.</p>
