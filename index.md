    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This paper aims to detect structural break
    points in latent networks in a panel data setting. We consider panel models
    where the outcome of a unit depends on the outcomes and characteristics of
    other units. The latent network structure induces high-dimensional
    parameters and interactive outcomes generate endogeneity. Our goal is to
    detect breaks in high-dimensional network parameters associated with
    endogenous variables. We propose a two-step penalized nonlinear least
    squares approach to estimate the break points based on reduced forms, and
    show that the resulting estimator achieves superconsistency. This property
    allows us to estimate, and make inferences on, network and slope parameters
    as if the true break points were known.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Cross-regional mergers and acquisitions
    (M&amp;A) transfer control and diffuse knowledge across space, which
    facilitates the integration of business systems. We analyse about 40,000
    cross-regional acquisitions in Europe completed between 2003 and 2017 and
    distinguish innovative and non-innovative M&amp;A. Both types of deals
    cluster into communities constituted by countries or groups of neighbouring
    countries. However, an increasing proportion of deals connect different
    communities, especially for innovative M&amp;A. More populous and richer
    regions host more acquiring and target companies and thus broker
    communities. Research and development expenditure and skilled human capital
    are additional factors favouring brokerage of regions by attracting
    acquirers.</p>

    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This paper considers the estimation and inference of spatial panel data
    models with heterogeneous spatial lag coefficients, with and without weakly
    exogenous regressors, and subject to heteroskedastic errors. A quasi maximum
    likelihood (QML) estimation procedure is developed and the conditions for
    identification of the spatial coefficients are derived. The QML estimators of
    individual spatial coefficients, as well as their mean group estimators, are
    shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. Small‐sample properties of
    the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations and
    results are shown to be in line with the paper's key theoretical findings,
    even for panels with moderate time dimensions and irrespective of the number
    of cross‐section units. A detailed empirical application to US house price
    changes during the 1975–2014 period shows a significant degree of
    heterogeneity in spatiotemporal dynamics over the 338 Metropolitan
    Statistical Areas considered.</p>

  <strong>Robust estimation and moment selection in dynamic fixed-effects panel data models</strong><br />

    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Considering linear dynamic panel data models with fixed effects,
    existing outlier–robust estimators based on the median ratio of two
    consecutive pairs of first-differenced data are extended to higher-order
    differencing. The estimation procedure is thus based on many pairwise
    differences and their ratios and is designed to combine high precision and
    good robust properties. In particular, the proposed two-step GMM estimator
    based on the corresponding moment equations relies on an innovative
    weighting scheme reflecting both the variance and bias of those moment
    equations, where the bias is assumed to stem from data contamination. To
    estimate the bias, the influence function is derived and evaluated. The
    robust properties of the estimator are characterized both under
    contamination by independent additive outliers and the patches of additive
    outliers. The proposed estimator is additionally compared with existing
    methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This paper extends an existing outlier-robust estimator of linear dynamic
    panel data models with fixed effects, which is based on the median ratio of
    two consecutive pairs of first-order differenced data. To improve its
    precision and robustness properties, a general procedure based on
    higher-order pairwise differences and their ratios is designed. The
    asymptotic distribution of this class of estimators is derived. Further, the
    breakdown point properties are obtained under contamination by independent
    additive outliers and by the patches of additive outliers, and are used to
    select the pairwise differences that do not compromise the robustness
    properties of the procedure. The proposed estimator is additionally compared
    with existing methods by means of Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The panel-data regression models are frequently applied to micro-level
    data, which often suffer from data contamination, erroneous observations, or
    unobserved heterogeneity. Despite the adverse effects of outliers on
    classical estimation methods, there are only a few robust estimation methods
    available for fixed-effects panel data. A new estimation approach based on
    two different data transformations is therefore proposed. Considering several
    robust estimation methods applied to the transformed data, the robust and
    asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, including their
    breakdown points and asymptotic distributions. The finite-sample performance
    of the existing and proposed methods is compared by means of Monte Carlo
    simulations.</p>

  <strong>Innovative mergers and acquisitions and the integration of European regions</strong><br />

    </summary>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) entail the substantial reallocation of
    economic activities. When they involve distant acquiring and target
    companies, they transfer control and diffuse knowledge across locations,
    which in turn facilitates the process of the integration of business systems.
    This study aims to understand how cross-regional European M&amp;A facilitate the
    process of European integration. We applied social network analysis and
    regression techniques to a sample of cross-regional acquisitions between 2003
    and 2017. The data allow us to identify whether or not a target company had
    an active patent portfolio at the time of deal completion. Both types of
    deals are highly concentrated in economically more developed regions and
    cluster into communities constituted by countries or groups of neighbouring
    countries. However, a large and increasingly non-trivial proportion of deals
    connect different communities, and to a larger extent for innovative than for
    non-innovative M&amp;A. More populous and richer regions host a disproportionally
    larger number of acquiring and target companies and thus connect fragmented
    communities. The intensity of R&amp;D-related expenditures provides an additional
    factor favouring the connection of fragmented groups of regions by attracting
    technology-seeking acquirers.</p>
